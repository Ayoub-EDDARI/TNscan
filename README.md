# TNscan
this little tool which is the same idea of sa scan by al-swisre, Hope you like it coz it was made with <3
you just need python 2 to run it but with same editing you can make it work under python 3.

i think it's an AIO of all my tools that i published and the ones that still on my hard drive .
